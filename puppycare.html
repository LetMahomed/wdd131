                <h1>How to Take Care of a Puppy</h1>
                <p>
                    Taking care of a puppy requires time, effort, and a lot of patience. Here are some essential tips to help you take care of your new furry friend.
                </p>
                <h2>Feeding</h2>
                <p>
                    Provide your puppy with a balanced diet that is appropriate for their age, size, and breed. Puppies typically need to eat three to four times a day. Make sure to provide fresh water at all times.
                </p>
                <h2>Training</h2>
                <p>
                    Start training your puppy early. Basic commands like sit, stay, and come are essential. Positive reinforcement techniques, such as treats and praise, work best.
                </p>
                <h2>Exercise</h2>
                <p>
                    Puppies have a lot of energy and need regular exercise to stay healthy and happy. Daily walks, playtime, and socialization with other dogs are important.
                </p>
                <h2>Health Care</h2>
                <p>
                    Regular veterinary check-ups are crucial to ensure your puppy is healthy. Keep up with vaccinations, flea and tick prevention, and grooming.
                </p>
                <h2>Love and Attention</h2>
                <p>
                    Puppies need a lot of love and attention. Spend quality time with your puppy to build a strong bond and ensure they feel secure in their new home.
